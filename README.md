### Overview and Origin

* Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt are the founders of the company

* The company's mission was to "provide everyone with access to the financial market, not just the wealthy". The founders believe that traditional investment brokerage firms are charging too much on fees; they decide to create a platform where investors can trade commission-free

* The Robinhood app first showcased at LA Hacks, and launched in March 2015. The company initially raised $110 million at a $1.3 billion valuation; then went through a $363 million Series D financing. The company had raised a total of $539 million in venture capital funding, with the last valuation at $5.6 billion

The app now has more than 6 million users; and it has forced other big players, such as E-Trade, TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab to strat offering commision-free trading as well

* The core metric that companies in robo advisor domain use to measure success is AUM, or asset under management; the greater the amount of AUM, the more income for the company

### Recommendations

* Robinhood could expand their securities offering to the international market. Stocks that are traded on Asian exchanges or European exchanges

* The big players in this domain such as Vanguard and Schwab were already well-established in the market. The variety of financial products they are offering is one of the key elements for investor to fully diversify their portfolios.

* Robinhood could use ASP.NET to design dynamic web pages that showcase other international markets' information

* If Robinhood could offer real-time international markets information to its users on the website, users don't need to open up multiple apps at the same time, which will increase time spendt on Robinhood platform
